## 🔧 BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY

### What the Server Does:

1. **Content Analysis Pipeline**:
   ```
   Input Content
   ↓
   Pre-trained Models (RoBERTa, Emotion, NER, etc.)
   ↓
   Groq AI Analysis (Research, Analysis, Conclusion agents)
   ↓
   Revolutionary Detection (Phases 1-3)
   ↓
   Google Search Verification
   ↓
   Scoring & Verdict Calculation
   ↓
   RL Agent Suggestion (optional)
   ↓
   JSON Response with all results
   ```

2. **Models Used**:
   - RoBERTa Fake News Classifier
   - Emotion Classifier (7 emotions)
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Hate Speech Detector
   - Clickbait Detector
   - Bias Detector
   - Custom trained model (if available)

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/v1/analyze-chunks` - Main analysis endpoint (unified)
   - `POST /api/v1/analyze` - Legacy endpoint
   - `GET /health` - Server health check

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Backend Functionality NOT Changed:
✅ All backend modules work exactly as before
✅ No changes to analysis algorithms
✅ No changes to model loading
✅ No changes to scoring logic
✅ Both systems' functionality fully preserved

### What WAS Changed:
- Combined both servers into one unified server
- Created new unified frontend interface
- Merged content scripts for highlighting + sidebar
- Added better error handling
- Improved UI organization
- Made popup cleaner and more modern

### API Keys:
- **Groq API**: Already configured in `combined_server.py`
- **Google API**: Update `google_config.json` with your keys (optional)

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Server Won't Start:
```
Error: Port 5000 already in use
Solution: Kill existing process or change port in combined_server.py
```

### Extension Not Loading:
```
Error: Manifest error
Solution: Check manifest.json for syntax errors
```

### Models Not Loading:
```
Error: Model not found
Solution: Ensure D:\huggingface_cache exists and has models
Run: python -c "from transformers import AutoTokenizer; AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('hamzab/roberta-fake-news-classification')"
```

### No Analysis Results:
```
Error: Server connection failed
Solution: 
1. Check server is running (http://localhost:5000/health)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
3. Try reloading extension
```

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. **Start the Server**: Run `START_SERVER.bat`
2. **Load Extension**: Load `d:\mis_2\LinkScout\extension` in Chrome
3. **Test It**: Visit a news site and click "Scan Page"
4. **Enjoy**: Your combined extension is ready! 🎉

## 💡 WHICH EXTENSION TO LOAD?

**ANSWER: Load the NEW LinkScout extension!**

Location: `d:\mis_2\LinkScout\extension`

This is the combined extension that includes ALL features from both:
- ✅ mis extension (Groq AI, RL, Image Analysis, Revolutionary Detection)
- ✅ mis_2 extension (Pre-trained Models, Chunk Analysis, Google Search, Sidebar)

You can now UNLOAD the old extensions (mis and mis_2) and use only LinkScout.

- Combines Groq AI + Pre-trained Models
- Has all 8 phases of revolutionary detection
- Uses RL to learn and improve
- Provides clean, organized results
- Highlights suspicious content
- Shows analysis in sidebar
- Integrates Google search
- Maintains ALL backend functionality from both systems

**Name**: LinkScout
