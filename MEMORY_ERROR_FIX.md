# 🚨 MEMORY ERROR FIX - Windows Paging File Too Small

## Error You're Seeing
```
OSError: [WinError 1455] The paging file is too small for this operation to complete
```

This happens when Windows virtual memory (paging file) is too small to load PyTorch and all AI models.

## 🔧 QUICK FIX: Increase Windows Virtual Memory

### Step 1: Open System Properties
1. Press `Win + Pause/Break` OR
2. Right-click "This PC" → Properties
3. Click "Advanced system settings" (left sidebar)
4. Click "Settings" under Performance section

### Step 2: Increase Virtual Memory
1. Go to "Advanced" tab
2. Click "Change" under Virtual Memory
3. **Uncheck** "Automatically manage paging file size"
4. Select your system drive (usually C:)
5. Choose "Custom size"
6. Set **both** values:
   - **Initial size**: `16000 MB` (16 GB)
   - **Maximum size**: `32000 MB` (32 GB)
7. Click "Set"
8. Click "OK" on all windows
9. **RESTART YOUR COMPUTER**

### Step 3: After Restart
```bash
cd D:\mis_2\LinkScout
python combined_server.py
```

Server should now start successfully!

## ✅ What I Fixed in Code

I implemented **lazy loading** so models only load when actually needed:
- ✅ NER model: Loads on first entity extraction
- ✅ Hate Speech: Loads on first hate speech detection
- ✅ Clickbait: Loads on first clickbait check
- ✅ Bias: Loads on first bias analysis

**Before**: All 8 models loaded at startup (crashed)  
**After**: Only RoBERTa + Emotion load at startup, others load on-demand

## 🎯 Expected Startup After Fix

```
📱 Using device: cpu
🚀 Loading AI models...
Loading RoBERTa fake news detector...
✅ RoBERTa loaded
Loading emotion classifier...
✅ Emotion model loaded
⏳ NER model: lazy loading (loads on first use)
⏳ Hate Speech detector: lazy loading (loads on first use)
⏳ Clickbait detector: lazy loading (loads on first use)
⏳ Bias detector: lazy loading (loads on first use)
✅ Core models loaded (RoBERTa, Emotion)
🔧 Initializing Reinforcement Learning...
💾 [RL] No saved model found, starting fresh
🧠 RL Agent: READY (Episodes: 0)
✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

## 🆘 If You Can't Increase Virtual Memory

### Alternative 1: Use Lighter Server (MIS Directory)
The MIS server has better memory management:
```bash
cd D:\mis_2\mis
python agentic_server.py
```

### Alternative 2: Disable Some Models
Edit `combined_server.py` and comment out models you don't need.

### Alternative 3: Add More RAM
If your PC has <8GB RAM, consider upgrading to 16GB+.

## 📊 Current System Requirements

**Minimum**:
- RAM: 8GB
- Virtual Memory: 16GB
- Disk Space: 10GB (for models cache)

**Recommended**:
- RAM: 16GB+
- Virtual Memory: 32GB
- Disk Space: 20GB

## ✅ After Server Starts

1. Reload LinkScout extension (chrome://extensions/)
2. Visit any news article
3. Click LinkScout icon
4. Click "Scan Page"
5. RL system works with feedback buttons!

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025  
**Issue**: Windows paging file too small for PyTorch + 8 AI models  
**Solution**: Increase virtual memory to 16-32GB + Lazy loading implemented
